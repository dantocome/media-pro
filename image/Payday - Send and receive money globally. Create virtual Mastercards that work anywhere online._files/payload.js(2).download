While it may not be a long-term solution for happiness, there are some reasons why retail therapy can provide short-term benefits and a boost to one&#8217;s mood.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet’s take a glimpse into what happens in the brain during retail therapy:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Dopamine Release:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Shopping and making a purchase can stimulate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. Dopamine activates the brain&#8217;s reward system, creating feelings of enjoyment and reinforcing the behavior. This dopamine surge contributes to the immediate mood-enhancing effect of retail therapy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Endorphin Activation: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EEngaging in retail therapy can also activate the release of endorphins, which are the brain&#8217;s natural pain-relieving and mood-boosting chemicals. Endorphins promote feelings of pleasure, relaxation, and overall well-being. The anticipation of making a purchase and the act of acquiring something new can trigger endorphin release, contributing to a positive emotional experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Psychological Distraction:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Retail therapy can provide a psychological distraction from stress, negative emotions, or daily life challenges. When individuals engage in shopping, their focus shifts to browsing, selecting items, and considering purchase decisions. This diversion of attention can temporarily alleviate distress and help create a more positive mental state.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Self-Expression and Identity Enhancement: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EShopping and selecting items that resonate with one&#8217;s personal style or interests can activate brain regions associated with self-expression and identity. The brain areas involved in self-relevance and self-concept, such as the prefrontal cortex, may become engaged during the process of shopping, allowing individuals to assert their identity and enhance their self-esteem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Visual Stimulation:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The visual aspects of shopping, including attractive displays, aesthetically pleasing products, and novel environments, can stimulate the brain&#8217;s visual processing centers. This visual stimulation can evoke positive emotions and enhance the overall shopping experience.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s important to note that the brain&#8217;s response to retail therapy may vary among individuals, and not everyone experiences the same degree of pleasure or neurological activation. Factors such as personal preferences, past experiences, and individual brain chemistry can influence specific neural responses during retail therapy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile retail therapy can provide temporary mood improvement, it&#8217;s essential to approach it mindfully and in moderation. It&#8217;s important to maintain a healthy balance between treating oneself and maintaining financial well-being, as excessive or compulsive shopping can lead to financial difficulties and negative consequences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Retail-therapy-vs-shopping-addiction\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERetail therapy vs shopping addiction\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERetail therapy and shopping addiction, though related to shopping behavior, are distinct concepts with different implications.

Occasional and Controlled: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003ERetail therapy is typically occasional, limited to specific instances where individuals intentionally engage in shopping to boost their mood. It is a controlled behavior that individuals can choose to indulge in as a form of self-care or enjoyment.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Temporary Mood Enhancement:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The primary motivation behind retail therapy is the pursuit of an immediate mood boost or emotional relief. It provides a temporary escape from negative emotions, stress, or boredom. The positive effects are typically short-lived and do not significantly interfere with daily life or lead to negative consequences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Mindful and Enjoyable:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Retail therapy can be a conscious and deliberate activity, where individuals actively choose to engage in shopping as a means of self-expression, enjoyment, or relaxation. It is typically associated with positive emotions, self-indulgence, and the pursuit of personal preferences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShopping Addiction\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShopping addiction, also known as compulsive buying disorder or oniomania is a more severe and potentially harmful condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to shop and excessive purchasing behaviors. Some distinguishing features of shopping addiction include:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Compulsive and Uncontrolled:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Shopping addiction involves an inability to resist the urge to shop, leading to frequent and impulsive buying episodes. Individuals with shopping addiction often feel a loss of control over their shopping behavior and find it challenging to limit or stop their shopping activities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Negative Consequences:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Shopping addiction can have severe negative consequences, both financially and emotionally. It often leads to significant debt, financial instability, strained relationships, and feelings of guilt, shame, or regret. The compulsive buying behavior may interfere with daily functioning, work productivity, and overall well-being.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Psychological Dependence: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EShopping addiction can be driven by underlying emotional issues, such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, or a need for validation. Individuals with a shopping addiction may rely on shopping as a coping mechanism, using it as a way to regulate emotions or fill an emotional void.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Lack of Satisfaction:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Unlike retail therapy, shopping addiction does not provide lasting satisfaction or fulfillment. Individuals with a shopping addiction may experience a continuous cycle of craving, buying, and subsequent feelings of dissatisfaction or emptiness. This can perpetuate the compulsive behavior and reinforce the addiction.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s important to note that shopping addiction is recognized as a mental health condition, and individuals struggling with it may benefit from seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling.

Mood Enhancement:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Engaging in retail therapy can trigger the release of endorphins, which are known as &#8220;feel-good&#8221; hormones. The act of shopping, exploring new products, and finding items that bring joy or excitement can elevate your mood and provide a temporary sense of happiness. Dopamine increases your desire to continue to seek out things that make you feel good (hence retail therapy being a favorite go-to!)\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Self-Expression and Identity:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Shopping allows individuals to express their personal style and preferences. It can be a way to experiment with different looks, discover new trends, and cultivate a sense of individuality. Selecting items that align with your values and interests can help strengthen your self-identity and boost your self-confidence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Stress Relief:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Retail therapy can serve as a form of relaxation and escape from daily stressors. Immersing oneself in a shopping experience can provide a distraction from worries or concerns, allowing the mind to focus on the present moment and enjoy the process of browsing and selecting items. Shopping also stimulates the senses.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Social Interaction:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Shopping can be a social activity, whether it involves going to a physical store with friends or engaging in online shopping discussions and recommendations. Interacting with others who share similar interests or seeking advice from sales associates can provide a sense of connection and enhance social well-being.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Sense of Control: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003ERetail therapy allows individuals to exert control over their choices and surroundings. In a world where many things feel beyond our control, making purchasing decisions can provide a sense of autonomy and empowerment. It can be particularly beneficial for those who may feel overwhelmed or powerless in other aspects of their lives.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Goal Achievement and Reward: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003ESetting small shopping-related goals, such as saving up for a particular item or treating yourself after accomplishing a milestone, can create a sense of achievement. Rewarding yourself for your efforts can reinforce positive behavior and motivate you to continue pursuing your goals.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7.

It can also be psychologically therapeutic if you save up for that reward rather than buying something immediately with a credit card or on credit.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApplying the theory of anticipation, saving up for your reward gives you something to look forward to, which creates excitement and a release of dopamine over time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile retail therapy can have its benefits, it&#8217;s important to approach it mindfully and responsibly. It&#8217;s essential to strike a balance between treating oneself and maintaining financial well-being. Engaging in retail therapy should not be used as a substitute for addressing deeper emotional needs or as a coping mechanism for underlying issues.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"When-does-shopping-become-a-problem?\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen does shopping become a problem?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile retail therapy can have its benefits, it&#8217;s important to be aware of when it may become a problem.

Financial Strain:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E If engaging in retail therapy causes significant financial strain or leads to overspending beyond one&#8217;s means, it can become a problem. This may include accumulating debt, neglecting essential expenses, or experiencing difficulty meeting financial obligations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Compulsive Buying: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EWhen the urge to shop becomes overwhelming and individuals feel a loss of control over their shopping habits, it may indicate a problem. Compulsive buying can involve frequent and impulsive purchases, regardless of need or financial consequences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Emotional Dependence: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EUsing retail therapy as the primary or sole means of coping with negative emotions, stress, or other psychological challenges can be problematic. Relying heavily on shopping to regulate mood or escape from underlying issues may indicate an unhealthy dependence.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Interference with Daily Life:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E If retail therapy begins to interfere with daily functioning and responsibilities, such as neglecting work, relationships, or personal well-being, it may be a sign of problematic behavior. When shopping becomes a priority over essential aspects of life, it can have negative consequences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Emotional Regret:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Feeling a sense of guilt, remorse, or regret after engaging in retail therapy on a consistent basis may be a red flag. If shopping leads to emotional distress, strained relationships, or a sense of dissatisfaction, it&#8217;s important to evaluate the underlying reasons and consider seeking support.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you recognize any of these signs in yourself or someone you know, it may be beneficial to seek professional help or support.

These challenges can hinder the efficiency, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of international money transfers. Let’s dive into what some of these major challenges are:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Limited Banking Infrastructure: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EMany regions in Africa lack adequate banking infrastructure, especially in rural areas. This limits the availability and accessibility of banking services, making it difficult for individuals and businesses to engage in cross-border payments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. High Remittance Costs: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe cost of sending and receiving money across borders in Africa is often high.

Lack of Financial Inclusion:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E A large portion of Africa&#8217;s population remains unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to formal financial services. This makes it challenging for individuals to participate in cross-border payments, as they may not have bank accounts or the proper identification documents required for verification.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Currency Exchange and Volatility:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Africa has multiple currencies, and exchange rates can fluctuate significantly. This introduces complexity and uncertainty to cross-border payments, making it challenging to determine the exact amount to be sent or received and increasing the risk of currency depreciation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Regulatory Hurdles: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EInconsistent and complex regulatory frameworks across African countries pose challenges for cross-border payments. Varying regulations, compliance requirements, and anti-money laundering measures can delay transactions and increase costs, creating barriers to efficient cross-border payments.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Limited Technology Infrastructure: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EIn some regions, inadequate technology infrastructure and limited access to the internet pose obstacles to cross-border payments. Without reliable connectivity and access to digital platforms, individuals and businesses face difficulties initiating and completing transactions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Informal Payment Systems:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Informal payment systems, such as hawala or informal remittance networks, are prevalent in Africa. While these systems facilitate cross-border transactions, they often operate outside formal channels, making it harder to monitor and regulate transactions and potentially increasing the risk of money laundering and fraud.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Security Concerns:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Cybersecurity threats and fraud are significant challenges in cross-border payments. Weak digital security measures and inadequate awareness about online scams make individuals and businesses vulnerable to financial losses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAddressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from governments, financial institutions, and technology providers to enhance infrastructure, improve regulations, promote financial inclusion, and foster innovation in cross-border payment solutions tailored to the African context.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How-do-Cross-Border-Payments-for-Bank-Transfers-Work-in-Africa?\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do Cross-Border Payments for Bank Transfers Work in Africa?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECross-border payments in Africa can be complex due to various factors, including different currencies, regulatory frameworks, and technological infrastructures.

Initiation: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe cross-border payment process begins when an individual or business initiates a payment to a recipient in another African country.

Currency Conversion:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E If the sender and recipient use different currencies, the payment amount is converted into the recipient&#8217;s currency. This conversion can be done by the sender&#8217;s bank or through a third-party currency exchange provider.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Fund Transfer:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The sender&#8217;s bank or payment service provider initiates the transfer of funds to the recipient&#8217;s bank in the destination country. This is typically done using the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) network, which enables secure messaging and settlement between banks globally.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Intermediary Banks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E In some cases, the payment may pass through one or more intermediary banks that facilitate the transfer between the sender&#8217;s bank and the recipient&#8217;s bank. These intermediary banks may deduct fees for their services, which can affect the final amount received by the recipient.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Processing and Clearing: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe recipient&#8217;s bank processes the incoming payment and verifies the beneficiary details.

Notification and Confirmation: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EOnce the payment is successfully received, the recipient&#8217;s bank notifies the recipient of the incoming funds. The sender may also receive confirmation from their bank or payment service provider that the payment has been delivered.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s important to note that the specific steps and processes involved in cross-border payments can vary depending on the countries involved, the financial institutions or payment service providers used, and any regional initiatives or agreements that may be in place to facilitate cross-border transactions.

Card Issuance: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe first step is for an individual or business to obtain a payment card from a bank or financial institution.

Card Network: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EMost payment cards in Africa are affiliated with major card networks such as Visa, Mastercard, or UnionPay.

Point of Sale (POS) or Online Payment: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003ETo make a cross-border payment, the cardholder can use their payment card at a physical point of sale terminal or for online purchases. The card details, including the card number, expiration date, and CVV, are typically required.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Authorization: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EWhen the payment card is used, the merchant sends the transaction details to the acquiring bank or payment processor.

Card Network Authorization:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E The card network checks the transaction details and verifies the cardholder&#8217;s account balance or credit limit. They also validate the transaction against fraud prevention measures. If the transaction is approved, an authorization code is generated and sent back to the merchant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6. Settlement: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EOnce the transaction is authorized, the acquiring bank settles the payment with the merchant. Settlement refers to the transfer of funds from the cardholder&#8217;s account to the merchant&#8217;s account. This process typically involves interbank clearing and settlement systems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Currency Conversion:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E In the case of cross-border payments where the transaction is made in a different currency than the card&#8217;s native currency, currency conversion is necessary. The card network or card issuer applies exchange rates to convert the transaction amount into the cardholder&#8217;s currency.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E8. Foreign Exchange (FX) Fees:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Card issuers often charge foreign exchange fees for cross-border transactions to cover the costs associated with currency conversion. These fees can vary between issuers and may be a percentage of the transaction amount or a fixed fee.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Cardholder Billing: \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EThe cardholder receives a monthly statement from their card issuer, detailing all the transactions made using their payment card, including cross-border payments.

My job was to help the customers integrate virtual websites, and sometimes create virtual tours and walk them through using certain tools to showcase their products. In many cases, I was the first point of contact whenever they had issues with our services.

My career in tech has always revolved around fixing issues that had some level of technicality, and that somehow eased me into liking the idea of Support.

But one thing was sure, I had professions I knew I would not do, ex. I was never going to be an accountant.

The entire process from negotiating, collaborations to attending the sessions or going from a concept document that was sent to you, to an actual album on the charts. It’s a very interesting process to look back on and go through. I also listen to music a lot to help block out my thoughts from wandering. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, with your job and off your job you love to listen to music, how do you keep up with your streaming platform subscriptions?

Apple Music stopped taking Nigerian cards and when I can&#8217;t play music, I can&#8217;t function, I will lose my mind because my head voice is very active so I use music to block those voices out. So this was very frustrating so I tweeted about it and people recommended Payday and Chippercash so I went ahead to download the two apps. I did not go ahead with Chipper because they needed me to hold up my valid ID and I did not have it with me so Payday was the faster option for me and now I don’t just use it for Apple music payments but other things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat’s your favorite thing about the payday app so far?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe currency swap definitely. I just need to convince the person who wants to send me money to download the Payday app, fund it, send money to my USD or GBP account via my payday tag and I’ll swap it, very fast and easy and the rates are very friendly, all within the same system. It just makes doing global transactions very easy and convenient.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI love the currency swap as well. \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETemple, one might say the entertainment industry is an easy field.

I met someone who told me that she actually doesn&#8217;t have a voice in her head that she thinks in abstract concepts and that’s foreign to me because I think in colors, pictures and images so my ideas are very visual in my head and sometimes I end up micromanaging people which can be tough.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the one thing you’re most excited about in this industry?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne very important thing that I think is very exciting to see is that people are now looking for and embracing a lot of alternative methods of financing the music business. A lot of people are no longer going the traditional route, trying to get an agency to sign them. They are okay with releasing their own music for a while and then attracting people who are willing to be investors then giving them a huge form of ownership. Because, when you sign to a record label, they own your masters for a while. So for some people, the label owns your masters for tens of years before it’s finally all yours. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat advice would you give to emerging talent managers?\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, learn what exactly talent management\u002F A&amp;R entails because to be frank, a lot of people do not understand what it entails, the stress that comes with having to network, the patience you need to micromanage talents and do it well, the entire scope of work. So most times when they then enter the talent management market without these skills, it’s very easy for them to mess up even when it’s unintentional and it then appears like they do not have the artists’ best interest at heart and that’s one of the worst situations to find yourself in.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n",protected:e},excerpt:{rendered:"\u003Cp\u003EAs a talent manager, I am constantly
